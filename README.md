# manage azure blob store
Azure Blob Storage using a .NET Core Console Application.

With this application you can create containers, upload blobs to azure storage, list all of the blobs in a container, download the blobs to your local computer or delete containers easily using the Azure Blob Storage Client Library v12!

I wrote a medium about it. You can chack it here:
